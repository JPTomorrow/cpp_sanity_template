# C++ Sanity Template

A good template for starting out with C++ with a build system that doesn't make you sad :)

## Requirments
- CMake
- Ninja Build System
- A good c++ compiler for your prefered OS (I use MSVC/Clang most of the time, but anything will do as long as cmake can find it)

### Works best with VSCode with the following extensions
- CMake Highlight
- CMake Tools
- C/C++ (Microsoft)
- C/C++ Extension Pack (Microsoft)

## Building (WIP)

Working on a comprehensive guide. coming soon!

## TODO
- add testing libraries and frameworks
- cleanup .vscode folder stuff and see if any of it is even needed
- possibly add some small fun example programs (SDL3 game?)
